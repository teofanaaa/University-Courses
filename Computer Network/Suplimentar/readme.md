<p>A client server implementation in C for the number guess problem. The server chooses a random number. The clients connect and send numbers to server.The server returns to each client a status message:</p>
<ul>
  <li>send a larger number</li>
  <li>send a lower number</li>
  <li>you guessed my number</li>
  <li>another client guessed the number. You are a looser !</li>
